00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.810
I see darkness where there was light.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.280
I find fear where there was joy.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.680
The coldness shakes my body,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.680
and I’m running out of air.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.500
I’ve never felt this way before.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.200
Sometimes my own head is the worst place to be.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.000
I can only hear my own thoughts

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.000
and while I’m not necessarily sad,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.770
I just feel really empty.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.170
Time has no meaning,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.000
yet makes me feel lost,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.000
so I don’t know where to go in this paralyzing world.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.340
I’m confused and scared of falling into the unknown,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.000
though I’ve been holding on for so long.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.300
I’m finally drowned in my deepest thoughts to eventually realize that,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.000
though I used to think I wanted to disappear,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
all I ever wanted was to disconnect.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.000
Since everything changed,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.580
I‘ve found a place to breathe.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.720
I've started looking at things in another way,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.720
trying to break the repeating habits.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.050
While the world was asleep,
