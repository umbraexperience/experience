00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.810
I see darkness where there was light.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.280
I find fear where there was joy.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.680
The coldness shakes my body,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.680
and I’m running out of air.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.500
I’ve never felt this way before.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.200
Sometimes my own head is the worst place to be.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.000
I can only hear my own thoughts

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.000
and while I’m not necessarily sad,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.770
I just feel really empty.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.170
Time has no meaning,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.000
yet makes me feel lost,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.000
so I don’t know where to go in this paralyzing world.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.340
I’m confused and scared of falling into the unknown,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.000
though I’ve been holding on for so long.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.300
I’m finally drowned in my deepest thoughts to eventually realize that,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.000
though I used to think I wanted to disappear,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
all I ever wanted was to disconnect.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.000
Since everything changed,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.580
I‘ve found a place to breathe.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.720
I've started looking at things in another way,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.720
trying to break the repeating habits.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.050
While the world was asleep,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.700
I was standing cowardly thinking

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.820
what could've been but never ever would be

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.910
Then, something deep inside me,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.910
made me realize I wasn’t doing what I really longed for.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.300
Was I an autonomous thinker,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.150
or were my thoughts controlled by something else?

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.520
There was a constant pressure over me,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.480
everyone else trying to know me better than I did myself.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.180
Now I question

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.480
whether it was to improve my life or to take advantage of me.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.120
Everything I did was constantly on a scale of one to ten,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.660
making me feel really obsessed,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.720
taking away my free will.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.200
I was chained by monotony,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.960
trapped in a system where time was collapsed

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.660
and no one even bothered to think.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.490
But why did I feel so good doing the unexpected?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.220
Actions always have their own consequences,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.000
sometimes good, sometimes bad.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.620
The latter for some people can be a permanent state,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.000
but for others can be transitory to get to a better place.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.440
Loneliness is always seen as a terrible emotion,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.500
but for me it was the price to escape from society

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.100
and achieve my goal.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.700
That's why I finally decided to delete myself and disappear.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.400
Since I’ve been gone I’ve never felt so free.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.940
I finally have the freedom to choose,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.260
which I’ve been waiting for all this time.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.120
Yet now, that nothing tells me who I must be,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.200
I’m lost finding myself, constantly asking myself,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.500
who am I now that I’m really me?
