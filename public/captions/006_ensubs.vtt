00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
Everything I did was constantly on a scale of one to ten,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.660
making me feel really obsessed,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.040
taking away my free will.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.140
I was chained by monotony,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.560
trapped in a system where time was collapsed

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.350
and no one even bothered to think.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.050
But why did I feel so good doing the unexpected?

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.040
Actions always have their own consequences,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.820
sometimes good, sometimes bad.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.500
The latter for some people can be a permanent state,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.820
but for others can be transitory to get to a better place.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.940
Loneliness is always seen as a terrible emotion,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.520
but for me it was the price to escape from society

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.920
and achieve my goal.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.610
That's why I finally decided to delete myself and disappear.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.570
Since I’ve been gone I’ve never felt so free.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.880
I finally have the freedom to choose,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.140
which I’ve been waiting for all this time.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.520
Yet now, that nothing tells me who I must be,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.910
I’m lost finding myself, constantly asking myself,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.470
who am I now that I’m really me?
